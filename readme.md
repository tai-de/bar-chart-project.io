Functional Requirements
===

You should have a simple API to draw a bar chart. The function should be used by your HTML page to render the chart into your demo page. The signature of the function should be as follows:

`drawBarChart(data, options, element);`

The data parameter will be the data the chart should work from Start with just an Array of numbers
e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

The `options` parameter should be an object which has options for the chart.
e.g. `width` and `height` of the bar chart

The `element` parameter should be a DOM element or jQuery element that the chart will get rendered into.

Display Requirements
===

## Bar Chart
Display a list of single values, horizontally as a bar chart
* Numerical values should also be displayed inside of the bar
* The position of values should be customizable too:
    * Top, centre or bottom of the bar.

Bar sizes should be dependent on the data that gets passed in
* Bar `width` should be dependent on the total amount of values passed.
* Bar `height` should be dependent on the values of the data.

Bar properties that should be customizable:
* Bar Colour
* Label Colour
* Bar spacing (space between bars)
* Bar Chart axes

X-axis should show labels for each data value

* Think about how you would need to structure your data to associate a label to each value

Y-axis should show ticks at certain values

* Think about where you would configure these values. Should they be part of the data or the options to the bar chart function.

The title of the bar chart should be able to be set and shown dynamically

The title of the bar chart should also be customizable:

* Font Size
* Font Colour

## Multiple Value (Stacked) bar charts

Allow the user to pass multiple values for each bar.

* Think about how you would need to structure this data compared to a single bar chart.

This should also support all the features of the single bar chart, including

* Customizable bar colours, per value
* Customizable label colours
